# Snake Game üêç

A classic Snake Game built using Python's `turtle` module and Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts. This game is a great demonstration of OOP principles, such as encapsulation, inheritance, and modular design.

## Features
- The game window is set to a 600x600 size with a black background.
- Control the snake using the arrow keys to navigate around the screen.
- The game ends if the snake collides with the wall or its own tail.
- Score tracking with the highest score saved in a file.

## Prerequisites
Make sure you have Python installed on your system. This project uses the built-in `turtle` module, so no additional installations are required.

## Installation
